The uploaded documents represent the version of the dissertation that was submitted for **pre-defense** evaluation. Pre-defense is a stage in the PhD process where one internal and one external reviewer form an opinion about the contents and suggest correction and is required before one can sumbit the final version to the target university's PhD program.
